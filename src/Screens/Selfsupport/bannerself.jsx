//                         The first time I had to talk about finances at a district meeting when I was my
//                         area’s treasurer, a fellow in the back of the room yelled out: “Why in the world
//                         are you always talking about money when this is a spiritual program?” The guy
//                         threw me and I didn’t know how to answer him.

//                         This marked a turning point in A.A. history, and as the reality of Mr.
//                         Rockefeller’s statement sank in and A.A. members began to see the truth in the
//                         old cliché, “Who pays the piper calls the tune,” the seed of the Seventh
//                         Tradition took root.

//                         money necessary for A.A.’s survival would have to come from individual A.A.
//                         members and groups. As Bill W. put it in 1957, “Our spiritual way of life is
//                         safe for future generations if, as a Society, we resist the temptation to
//                         receive money from the outside world.”
